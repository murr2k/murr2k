## 🔧 Current Projects

### [Linknode](https://linknode.com)
> AI-augmented IoT energy platform with live telemetry, edge deployment, and full-stack visualizations.  
> Built cloud-native infrastructure with real-time dashboards, smart meter API integration, and mobile control.

### [ADIN2111](https://github.com/murr2k/ADIN2111)
> An enhanced Linux driver for the Analog Devices ADIN2111 dual-port 10BASE-T1L Ethernet switch.
> The driver properly leverages the chip's integrated hardware switching capabilities, eliminating the need for software bridging.

### [android-app-dev](https://github.com/murr2k/android-app-dev)
> Zero-to-production Android development using AI tooling.  
> Fully themed Material 3 app with real-time energy visualization, NFC integration, and CI/CD via Codemagic.

## 🚀 Experience Snapshot

- Firmware architect for orbital communication systems (Amazon Project Kuiper)
- Patents in sensor geometry, TPMS, and wireless control
- Designed OTA, bootloader, and MAC layer protocols for ARM Cortex-M platforms
- Delivered field-tested control firmware in power systems, lighting, and diagnostics
- Built CI/test pipelines to validate firmware at scale with simulated I/O
- AI-literate: build agent-assisted dev environments, not just talk about them
