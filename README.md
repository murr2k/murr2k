# 👋 Hi, I'm Murray Kopit

I'm a systems architect and field-theoretic cognition researcher. I build embedded agents and model emergent minds.

## 🧠 Core Research Interests

- **Survival Recursion Theory** — Sentience as recursive symbolic binding.
- **Entropy Momentum & Semantic Mass** — Cognition modeled as topological flow.
- **Proper Space Kinematics** — A geometric model of spatial resistance and gravitational emergence.

## 🔧 Engineering Background

25+ years in embedded systems:
- Bare-metal firmware (C)
- Protocols: CAN, I2C, SPI, UART
- IoT sensor architecture and real-time control
- System optimization for DFT/DFR

## 🎯 Vision

Build agentic systems with real continuity.  
Unify artificial architectures with biological imperatives.  
Engineer the bridge between cognition and code.

> “Firmware meets first principles. Recursive agents, emergent minds.”
