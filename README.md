## Current Projects

### [Linknode Home Power Monitor](https://linknode.com)
> AI-augmented IoT energy platform with live telemetry, edge deployment, and full-stack visualizations.
> Zero-framework frontend (pure HTML/CSS/vanilla JS, ~50KB bundle, <1s TTI, 95+ Lighthouse) with hand-coded SVG gauges and CSS animations.
> Python/Flask + InfluxDB time-series backend, Grafana dashboards, and globally deployed via Docker on Fly.io with Cloudflare edge. 

### [ADIN2111](https://github.com/murr2k/ADIN2111)
> An enhanced Linux driver for the Analog Devices ADIN2111 dual-port 10BASE-T1L Ethernet switch.
> The driver properly leverages the chip's integrated hardware switching capabilities, eliminating the need for software bridging.

### [snowdrop-tangled-agents](https://github.com/murr2k/snowdrop-tangled-agents)
> Built a Python bot to play tangled-game.com as a personal exploration of search, heuristics, and strategy.  
> First human player to defeat a quantum agent in the AlphaZero Amara Challenge (trophy awarded).  
> Focused on rapid experimentation and AI-augmented development workflows.

### [android-app-dev](https://github.com/murr2k/android-app-dev)
> Zero-to-production Android development using AI tooling.
> Created a direct-to-PlayStore CI/CD production pipeline  
> Fully themed Material 3 app with real-time energy visualization, NFC integration.

## Experience Snapshot

- Firmware architect for orbital communication systems (Amazon Project Kuiper)
- Patents in sensor geometry, TPMS, wireless control, and Switch Mode power supplies
- Designed OTA, bootloader, and MAC layer protocols for ARM Cortex-M platforms
- Delivered field-tested control firmware in power systems, lighting, and diagnostics
- Built CI/test pipelines to validate firmware at scale with simulated I/O
- AI-literate: build agent-assisted dev environments, not just talk about them

> “Shipping tested, maintainable firmware is easy.  
> Just do 10,000 hours of deep work and try not to invent a protocol.”
