CV

Murray Kopit is an independent researcher and embedded systems developer whose work spans theoretical physics, artificial intelligence, cognitive systems, and complex adaptive dynamics. His research is unified by a central question: *what minimal physical and computational structures must exist for organized, persistent, and intelligible behavior to arise at all?* **A single research sensibility is deployed across each of these domains rather than confined to a single field**.  His approach is unified by process-first ontology, recursive constraint, and state-space geometry.

Kopit is the author of several exploratory theoretical frameworks, including **Proper Space Kinematics (PSK)**, an interpretive model of gravitation and cosmology that reframes space as a uniformly densifying Euclidean substrate and time as densification rather than a coordinate dimension. In PSK, gravity emerges as wake geometry induced by density gradients, inertial and gravitational mass become identical phenomena, and light is modeled as state-sharing between matter that was geometrically coincident in past density states rather than as propagating particles. PSK is explicitly positioned as an **interpretive unification scaffold**, retaining the empirical successes of general relativity while proposing an alternative physical ontology. This interpretive stance reflects Kopit’s broader epistemological view of **AI as semantic instruments** for exploring coherence and implication, rather than arbiters of physical truth.

In parallel, Kopit has developed **Survival Recursion Theory**, a naturalistic account of sentience in which consciousness emerges from participation in recursively self-sustaining survival dynamics rather than from computation, symbolic reasoning, or linguistic complexity alone. Within this framework, DNA is treated as a symbolic survival field encoding historically viable perturbations of matter, and pleiotropy is understood as an inevitable consequence of layered evolutionary constraint rather than a defect of biological design. Consciousness is framed as a multi-scale survival-recursive phenomenon spanning molecular, cellular, neural, and symbolic substrates.

Kopit’s interests extend into systems biology and complex networks, where he has explored causal graph representations and optimization-based formulations of gene-editing under pleiotropic constraint. His work emphasizes that global genomic mastery is unlikely to be tractable in closed form, but that narrow-band control of specific subsystems may be achievable through surrogate modeling, constrained optimization, and hybrid classical–numerical computation.

Across these domains, Kopit treats engineered systems as **experimental substrates** for probing the same foundational questions that motivate his theoretical work. Hybrid solvers, game-playing agents, and optimization frameworks are not pursued as ends in themselves, but as concrete testbeds for exploring how structure, constraint, and representation shape the emergence of organized behavior in high-dimensional state spaces.

On the applied AI side, Kopit designs autonomous hybrid reasoning systems that integrate symbolic heuristics, classical search, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and high-throughput numerical computation. He recently built a **classical hybrid agent** that defeated a **quantum-trained AlphaZero-style agent** on the Petersen graph variant of the Tangled game. His system combines Python orchestration with MATLAB-accelerated numerical solvers, endgame lookup tables, neural priors, and adaptive heuristic learning, and operates without human supervision. He published the mathematical formulation, architecture, and source code, and built a live observability dashboard allowing real-time monitoring of agent behavior.

Kopit is also developing an FPGA-based intelligent power distribution architecture for safety-critical and high-density energy systems, currently under provisional patent. This work explores **power-neutral modulation** as a unifying principle for embedding communication, sensing, and safety signaling directly within switch-mode power delivery, without altering average duty cycle or delivered energy. The platform integrates in-band telemetry, correlation-based touch-safe sensing, and hardware-enforced protection with sub-microsecond response, enabling certifiable, diagnosable power subsystems for applications such as 5G infrastructure, distributed power networks, and industrial automation. Conceptually, this work extends Kopit’s broader interest in treating **physical processes themselves as information-bearing substrates** governed by constraint-first design.

Professionally, Kopit brings over three decades of experience as a **firmware developer and embedded systems architect**, creating control systems for safety-critical industrial, medical, power, and wireless platforms. He is Principal at **Linknode Technical & Design Service**, where he modernizes legacy embedded systems and builds deterministic communication bridges between industrial protocols such as Modbus and BACnet. He has served as Contract SDE III on **Amazon’s Project Kuiper**, developing bare-metal firmware for satellite communication MAC layers and leading mission test rehearsals for orbital validation. Earlier roles include firmware leadership at SST Wireless, Delta Controls, Cadex Electronics, and Philips/TIR Systems, among others.

Kopit is an inventor or co-inventor on multiple patents spanning power electronics, sensing, printing, and wireless localization. His engineering work is characterized by a strong emphasis on determinism, observability, and correctness under real-world constraints.

He views **AI as a semantic instrument** rather than an oracle: a tool for exploring the coherence and implications of theoretical structures, while physical truth remains anchored in observation, experiment, and constraint. Across all domains, his work seeks to replace surface-level descriptions with deeper geometric and dynamical pictures of what systems *are*, not merely how they behave. Current interests include hybrid optimization systems, foundational models of physical law, and the design of autonomous reasoning architectures grounded in constraint-first principles.

Kopit holds associate degrees in Engineering Science and Mathematics, and maintains an open research presence through GitHub and personal technical publications.
